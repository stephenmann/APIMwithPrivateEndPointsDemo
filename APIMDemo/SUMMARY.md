# Azure API Management with Private Endpoints Demo - Summary

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of Azure API Management with private endpoints, showcasing API versioning and secure network connectivity. The project includes:

1. **API Application**:
   - .NET Web API with versioned endpoints (v1 and v2)
   - Sample product and order management functionality
   - Proper service separation and versioning

2. **Infrastructure as Code**:
   - Complete Bicep templates for Azure deployment
   - Virtual Network configuration with appropriate subnets
   - API Management in internal network mode
   - Private endpoint and DNS zone configuration
   - App Service for backend hosting

## Running the Sample

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the APIMDemo folder
3. Run the API locally with:
   ```
   dotnet run
   ```
4. Browse to https://localhost:5001/swagger to explore the API endpoints

### Cloud Deployment

1. Navigate to the infra folder
2. Run the deployment script:
   ```powershell
   # PowerShell
   ./deploy.ps1 -SubscriptionId "<your-subscription-id>"
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   # Bash
   ./deploy.sh --subscription "<your-subscription-id>"
   ```
3. Alternatively, use the GitHub Actions workflow:
   - Go to the Actions tab in your repository
   - Select the "Deploy APIM Infrastructure" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Fill in the deployment parameters

## Architecture

This solution implements the following architecture:

- **Virtual Network** with isolated subnets
- **API Management** in internal network mode
- **Private Endpoint** for secure connectivity
- **App Service** with VNet integration
- **Private DNS Zone** for name resolution

## API Versioning

The API demonstrates versioning through:
- Different namespaces for v1 and v2 controllers
- Extended models in v2 (additional properties)
- New endpoints in v2 that weren't available in v1
- Version-specific API definitions in APIM

## Security Features

- APIM is deployed in internal network mode (not exposed to public internet)
- Private endpoints ensure traffic stays within Azure's backbone network
- Network security groups control traffic flow
- HTTPS-only communication

## Next Steps

1. Implement authentication and authorization
2. Add monitoring and logging
3. Configure CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
4. Implement rate limiting and throttling policies in APIM
